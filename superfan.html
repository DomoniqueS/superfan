		<p1>Sometimes I cry when im alone.I cry because im on my own.
	The tears I cry are bitter and warm.They flow with life but take
	no form.I cry because my heart is torn and I find it difficult to
	carry on,if I had ear to confide in I would cry among my treasured friends 
	but who do you know that stops that long to help another carry on 
	the world moves fast and it would rather pass you by than to 
	stop and see what makes you cry its painful and sad and sometimes
	I cry and no one cares about why</p1>
